Together, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes produce a basic Pokémon search application. The structure is established by the HTML, which also includes a section to show the results and a form for users to enter a Pokémon name. The page is styled by CSS, which adds interactive buttons, a soft background color, and clean fonts to make it visually appealing. JavaScript manages the interactivity in the meantime, retrieving information from the Pokémon API upon form submission. The name, image, height, weight, and type of the Pokémon are displayed if it is a legitimate Pokémon; if not, an error message is displayed.

All things considered, JavaScript adds dynamic functionality, CSS improves the design, and HTML supplies the layout. This combination demonstrates how these technologies can be used in unison to create dynamic and intuitive web applications.
